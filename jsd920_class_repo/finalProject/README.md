## Favorite Green Spaces in NYC
Mission: To share information about a selection of my favorite parks, botanical gardens, and outdoor green spaces from around the boroughs. 

### Functional Components
The application will display the Twitter feeds of the organizations that manage the parks/gardens/green spaces.

The application will incorporate a Google map highlighting the locations of the featured spaces.

The user will be able to choose to display/hide the various Twitter feeds.

The user will be able to choose a specific green space and highlight its location on the map in order to retrieve directions.

The application will provide a means for the webmaster to update the information on the site.

### Additional Information
The application will provide the website address and indicate whether each space has an admission fee. 

#### Nice to have
It may include a link to the Wikipedia article for individual spaces, if available. It might also show the current weather for individual spaces.
