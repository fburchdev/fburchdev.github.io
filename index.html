<h2>
Professional Background and Education
</h2>
	<p>I have worked primarily as a SDLC web developer in agency environments in the NYC metro area. My industry experience includes real estate, music publishing, non-profit, finance, and health care. I completed the first training program in Microsoft .NET technology offered at Baruch College CAPS in the early '00s, along with a 3 month immersive at SetFocus in Parsippany, NJ immediately following. Most recently I have been learning Ruby on Rails and AngularJS at New York Code + Design Academy and General Assembly.</p>
